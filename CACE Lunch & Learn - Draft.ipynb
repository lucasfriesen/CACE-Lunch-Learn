    "   - Each object in Python has an associated set of methods, which can be called using 'object.method' - this will make more sense as we move forward.\n",
    "   - Python has built-in functions that can be used - Ex. str(), list(), print(). However mostly all data analysis projects will require additional libraries that can be easily imported. Each library will have it's own functions and methods available."
